# jpacktool

  The JPacktool Agilhard-OSS Open-Source Project is intended to be part 
  of a solution to replace the use of the 
  [Java Webstart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Web_Start) technology
  which has been discontinued in newer JDK versions.

  It features the new [JPacktool Maven Plugin](./jpacktool-maven-plugin).

  The [JPacktool Maven Plugin](./jpacktool-maven-plugin) is based on the Agilhard-OSS 
  [JLink-JPackager Maven plugin](https://github.com/agilhard-oss/jlink-jpackager-maven-plugin).

  This in turn is based on the Apache [maven-jlink-plugin](https://github.com/apache/maven-jlink-plugin).

  The JPacktool Maven Plugin enhances the [jlink-jpackager-maven-plugin](https://github.com/agilhard-oss/jlink-jpackager-maven-plugin)
  by adding special features for projects using [update4j](https://github.com/update4j/update4j).

  Have a look at [jpacktool-maven-plugin/README.md](./jpacktool-maven-plugin/README.md)
  or the [JPacktool Maven Plugin Documentation](https://agilhard-oss.github.io/jpacktool-maven-plugin/site/index.html)
 for more information.
